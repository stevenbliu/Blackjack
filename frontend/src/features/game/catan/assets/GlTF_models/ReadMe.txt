Each building directory contains the models in different phases, with each phase folder containing the models in OBJ, FBX, and glTF (GLB) formats.

How to Use

    Extract the ZIP File:
        Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a location on your computer.

    Choosing the Right Format:
        OBJ + MTL: For compatibility with most 3D applications. Ensure the OBJ and MTL files are in the same directory.
        FBX: Best for importing into applications like Autodesk Maya, 3ds Max, or Unity.
        glTF/GLB: Ideal for web-based applications and modern 3D engines like Babylon.js and three.js.

    Importing Models:
        Open your 3D application of choice.
        Use the import function to load the model. Refer to the application's documentation for specific instructions on importing OBJ, FBX, or glTF/GLB files.

Notes

    Materials: The models come without textures or colors. You can apply your own materials and textures in your 3D software.
    Scale: Ensure to check the scale of the models upon importing. Adjustments might be necessary depending on your project requirements.
    Phases: Each building has three phases representing different levels of completion. Feel free to use them according to your project needs.
